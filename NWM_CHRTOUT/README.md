# Viewing NWM Channel Router for Study Basins

Downloaded data from Hydroshare which includes NWM v2.0 streamflow predictions, from a publication: !(https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/d750278db868447dbd252a8c5431affd)[https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/d750278db868447dbd252a8c5431affd]. Data contents: `model_outputs_for_analysis_mass_balance_paper.tar.gz`. Added to Pantarhei here: `/home/shared/uageology/model_runs_across_camels`.

Exported just the basins of interest to CSV files [`./v2.0/11473900.csv` , `./v2.0/11480390.csv`, `./v2.0/11528700.csv`].

Added a Jupyter Notebook to load in and plot those streamflow values: `view_streamflow.ipynb`.
